# Summer-2022-Internship-Documentation-Resources


This will be a documentation record of my progress of my research internship with the Computational Biomedicine deparment at Cedars-Sinai. This internship is focused on improving an AutoML model called 'STREAMLINE' where I would specifically be working on feature selection and possibly other smaller projects. More details to be updated as the internship progresses....

I will be posting various learning resources here that I came across to help me understand what Machine Learning is, how it works, the processes and algorithms involved in creating/improving AutoML.  This will serve for the next person who may have the wonderful opportunity to continue with the ongoing research.

**Projects:**
  1) Feature Selection: Shapley values/SHAP
